# Hackathon Notes & Development Status

## üèÜ What We Achieved

This project was built during a hackathon with significant time pressure. Here's what we accomplished:

### ‚úÖ Fully Working
1. **Google Gemini AI Integration**
   - Text restoration with expert-level Sanskrit knowledge
   - Morphological analysis and grammar rule application
   - Cultural context identification
   - Backend proxy architecture for secure API calls

2. **React Frontend**
   - Modern, responsive UI with Material-UI
   - Gemini restoration page with beautiful parchment theme
   - Multilingual translation display
   - AI Guru Chat interface
   - Text-to-Speech player
   - Export options

3. **FastAPI Backend**
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - Image upload handling
   - Translation services
   - Health checks and status endpoints

4. **Multilingual Support**
   - Sanskrit to English, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil translations
   - Maintains poetic rhythm and semantic accuracy
   - Copy and download capabilities

### üöß Partially Implemented (Hackathon Limitations)

1. **OCR Service** (`src/ocr/service.py`)
   - Basic Tesseract integration works
   - PaddleOCR support defined but not fully tested
   - Unicode normalization implemented
   - **Limitation**: Accuracy needs improvement with real manuscript images

2. **Model Service** (`src/models/`)
   - MT5 transformer architecture defined
   - Training pipeline created but not executed
   - **Limitation**: Model not fine-tuned on Sanskrit corpus (requires significant compute time)
   - Uses Gemini AI as primary engine instead

3. **Knowledge Graph** (`src/kg/build_kg.py`)
   - Neo4j configuration present in docker-compose
   - Graph building script created
   - **Limitation**: Graph not populated with Paninian grammar rules (time constraint)
   - Data structure defined but needs content

4. **Docker Deployment** (`docker-compose.yml`)
   - Service definitions complete
   - Dockerfiles created for all services
   - **Limitation**: Not fully tested in production environment
   - Works locally without Docker

5. **Episodic Memory & Meta-Learning** (`src/models/panini_t5.py`)
   - Architecture classes defined
   - Memory mechanisms coded
   - **Limitation**: Not trained or integrated (complex feature for hackathon timeline)

6. **Uncertainty Quantification**
   - Basic confidence scoring implemented
   - Visualization components created
   - **Limitation**: Calibration and advanced metrics incomplete

## üîß Technical Debt & Future Work

### High Priority
- [ ] Fine-tune MT5 model on Sanskrit manuscript corpus
- [ ] Improve OCR accuracy with PaddleOCR and custom preprocessing
- [ ] Complete knowledge graph with grammatical rules
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Implement proper error handling throughout
- [ ] Security: Move API keys to environment variables
- [ ] Add user authentication system

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Docker deployment testing and optimization
- [ ] Performance optimization and caching
- [ ] Add manuscript library/database
- [ ] Implement advanced sandhi splitting
- [ ] Expand multilingual support
- [ ] Add batch processing capabilities

### Low Priority
- [ ] Train episodic memory system
- [ ] Implement meta-learning adaptation
- [ ] Add advanced uncertainty metrics
- [ ] Create admin dashboard
- [ ] Mobile app version

## üí° Design Decisions (Under Time Pressure)

1. **Gemini AI as Primary Engine**: Instead of training our own model (would take days/weeks), we leveraged Google's Gemini AI with expert system prompts. This gave us production-quality results immediately.

2. **Backend Proxy Pattern**: To avoid CORS issues and secure API keys, all Gemini calls go through our FastAPI backend instead of direct frontend calls.

3. **Simplified OCR**: Used Tesseract for basic functionality instead of spending time fine-tuning PaddleOCR for manuscript-specific accuracy.

4. **Mock Data**: Several features use simulated/mock data to demonstrate UI and workflow without full backend implementation.

5. **Monolithic Backend**: Single `backend_server.py` instead of microservices for faster development and simpler deployment.

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **API Key Hardcoded**: Gemini API key is in source code (should use env vars)
2. **No Database**: Using in-memory storage (sessions dict) - resets on restart
3. **Limited Error Handling**: Some edge cases not covered
4. **No Input Validation**: Some endpoints lack robust validation
5. **Performance**: No caching or optimization for production scale
6. **OCR Accuracy**: Works better with printed text than handwritten manuscripts
7. **Build Directory Included**: React build/ directory should be in .gitignore

## üéØ If We Had More Time...

- Add advanced uncertainty quantification
- Performance optimization and caching
- Security audit and hardening

### Week 4
