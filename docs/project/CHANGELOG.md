## Migration Notes

### From Development to Production
When deploying to production:
1. Set all API keys via environment variables
2. Enable HTTPS/SSL
3. Configure proper CORS origins
4. Set up database (PostgreSQL recommended)
5. Enable rate limiting
6. Configure logging and monitoring
7. Set up backup systems
8. Use production-grade web server (Gunicorn + Nginx)
